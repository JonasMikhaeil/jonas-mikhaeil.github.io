excerpt: 'In many scientific disciplines, we are interested in inferring the nonlinear dynamicalsystem underlying a set of observed time series, a challenging task in the face ofchaotic behavior and noise. Previous deep learning approaches toward this goaloften suffered from a lack of interpretability and tractability. In particular, the high-dimensional latent spaces often required for a faithful embedding, even when theunderlying dynamics lives on a lower-dimensional manifold, can hamper theoreticalanalysis.   Motivated by the emerging principles of dendritic computation,  weaugment a dynamically interpretable and mathematically tractable piecewise-linear(PL) recurrent neural network (RNN) by a linear spline basis expansion. We showthat this approach retains all the theoretically appealing properties of the simplePLRNN, yet boosts its capacity for approximating arbitrary nonlinear dynamicalsystems in comparatively low dimensions.   We introduce two frameworks fortraining the system, one based on fast and scalable variational inference, and anothercombining BPTT with teacher forcing. We show that the dendritically expandedPLRNN achieves better reconstructions with fewer parameters and dimensions onvarious dynamical systems benchmarks and compares favorably to other methods,while retaining a tractable and interpretable structure.'

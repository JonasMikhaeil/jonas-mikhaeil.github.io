Hey, I'm Jonas! 

I'm a student in the beautiful city of Heidelberg, Germany. Here I'm currently persuing both a MSc in physics and a MA in philosophy at Heidelberg University.

My true passion lies in the question how we can arrive at understandable macroscopic discriptions of nature and society, which are intricitaly complex on their microscopic scale. 

### What we can learn from statistical physics

This is a question at the heart of physics, think for example of the complex behaviour of the myriad of particles in the room you are currently sitting in: On a macroscopic scale, all of this is describable in the interplay of two quantities, temperature and pressure. In its most fundamental, this move from the microscopic to the macroscopic is the domain of statistical physics. If we move to infinietly many degrees of freedom, we are in the regime of quantum field theory (QFT). Note though, that the techniques of QFT not only apply to quantum systems, they apply to every stochastical system. A more accurate name for QFT would actually be *statistical field theory*.

### Complexity is everywhere

The question of accurate macroscopic descriptions of systems that are to complex to comprehend on their fundamental level, is broadly relevant and is not restricted to the description of physical phenomena. 

Many of the social or economical questions we are interested in as a society run into the same problem. Descriptions on the fundamental level of those systems, the level of the individual, are hopeless of because of the shere number of people in our society and the complexity of our interactions.

The same problem faces neuroscience. A description of the entire brain on the level of single neurons, even if available, would be entirely incomprehensible to us humans. 

Our world in its microscopic intricacy is too complex for us to understand. We need to find sensible abrstractions to move to a macroscopic level, that we can make sense of.

### Models from data

In physics, we generally know the equations governing the microscopic but need methods to move to to a macroscopic description to make predictions. This is entirely different for other fields. Here we often do not know the underlying microscopic dynamics, or, as in the realm of the social, mathematical regularities only arise on an aggregate scale. But how can we then arrive at a description of these phenomenon?

The answer is that a lot of domain knowledge is (and always will be) required. Im'm interested in developing techniques to support this process of modelling by inferring models from data.

I'm currently working at the DurstewitzLab in the field of dynamial systems reconstruction. The idea is, that underyling every time-series there is a (hidden) process generating the data, a dynamical system. With the help of a special kind of recurrent neural network, we try to recover these underlying dynamics to be able to study the process in itself instead of just one realization of it.

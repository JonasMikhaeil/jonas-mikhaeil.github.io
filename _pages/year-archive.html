--- The following essays originated in my studies of philosophy at Heidelberg University. I was quite lucky to have the freedom to follow my quite particular interests at the intersection of philosophy and the natural sciences. Sadly, I did not get around to translate the essays into English yet, but if your interest is sparked, feel free get in touch and we can have a chat.

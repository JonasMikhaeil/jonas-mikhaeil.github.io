Research focused on the intersection of recurrent neural network (RNN) training, especially the exploding and vanishing gradient problem (EGVP), and dynamical systems theory. Together with Zahra Monfared, a postdoc mathematician, we found a close relationship between the long-term behaviour of an RNNs orbits and the loss gradients in training. Of particular relevance is our result that for RNNs with a chaotic attractor, the loss gradients in training will always diverge. Additionally to this theoretical analysis, I developed a new version of teacher forcing to train RNNs on chaotic data despite exploding gradients. Sharing equal contributions, we submitted our work under the title *How to train RNNs on chaotic data?.* The paper is currently under review for ICLR, a preprint can be found on arXiv.

In this [presentation](./../files/BN_posterAndVideo/7_mikhaeil_video.mp4), I presented my work on how to train RNNs on chaotic neural data. This includes theoretical findings on the relationship of RNNs long-term behaviour and its loss gradients in training, as well as a new variant of teacher-forcing, *sparsely forced BPPTT*, which allows to train on chaotic neural data.

Here are a short [video](./../files/BN_posterAndVideo/7_mikhaeil_video.mp4) describing our reseach and the corresponding [poster](./../files/BN_posterAndVideo/7_mikhaeil_poster.pdf).
